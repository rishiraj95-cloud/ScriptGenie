# Browser initialization
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.maximize_window()

# Pre-Required Conditions: Logged into the application as a registered user

# Scenario Name: User successfully adds item to cart
# Test Steps:
# 1. Navigate to the product page
driver.get("https://example.com/product-page")
# Received Outcome: Product page is displayed with all relevant details

# 2. Click on the "Add to Cart" button
add_to_cart_button = driver.find_element(By.ID, "add-to-cart-button")
add_to_cart_button.click()
# Received Outcome: Item is successfully added to the cart

# 3. Verify the cart icon updates with the correct item count
cart_icon = driver.find_element(By.ID, "cart-icon")
item_count = cart_icon.text
assert item_count == "1"
# Received Outcome: Cart icon displays the updated count reflecting the newly added item

# Scenario Name: User attempts to add item with insufficient stock
# Test Steps:
# 1. Navigate to the product page with limited stock
driver.get("https://example.com/limited-stock-product-page")
# Received Outcome: Product page is displayed with limited stock availability

# 2. Click on the "Add to Cart" button
add_to_cart_button = driver.find_element(By.ID, "add-to-cart-button")
add_to_cart_button.click()
# Received Outcome: Error message is displayed indicating insufficient stock

# 3. Verify that the cart is not updated with the out-of-stock item
cart_icon = driver.find_element(By.ID, "cart-icon")
item_count = cart_icon.text
assert item_count == "0"
# Received Outcome: Cart remains unchanged and does not reflect the out-of-stock item

# Scenario Name: User removes item from the cart
# Test Steps:
# 1. Go to the cart page
driver.get("https://example.com/cart")
# Received Outcome: Cart page is displayed showing all items added

# 2. Click on the "Remove" button next to the item
remove_button = driver.find_element(By.ID, "remove-button")
remove_button.click()
# Received Outcome: Item is successfully removed from the cart

# 3. Verify that the cart total is updated accordingly
cart_total = driver.find_element(By.ID, "cart-total")
assert cart_total.text == "0"
# Received Outcome: Cart total reflects the removal of the item and updates dynamically

# Regression Scenarios:
# - Related functionality that might be impacted: Checkout process
# - Integration points with other features: Payment gateway integration
# - Backward compatibility checks: Ensure the feature works on supported browsers
# - Performance implications: Check for any slowdowns in adding/removing items
# - Security considerations: Ensure user authentication and authorization are enforced
# - Edge cases and boundary conditions: Test with large quantities of items in the cart

# Close the browser
